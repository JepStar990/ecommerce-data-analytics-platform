# Web Scraper

## Overview
This Web Scraper is part of the E-commerce Data Analytics Platform project. It is designed to scrape product data from various e-commerce websites. The data collected includes product names, prices, ratings, and reviews, which are then stored in a structured format for further analysis.

## Features
- Scrapes product information from specified e-commerce websites.
- Extracts data such as product names, prices, ratings, and reviews.
- Stores the scraped data in CSV and JSON formats.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for scripting the web scraper.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Requests**: A Python library for sending HTTP requests.
- **Pandas**: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis (optional, for handling data before saving).

## Prerequisites
Before running the scraper, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)

Install the required Python libraries:
```sh

Copy code
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import pandas as pd

# URL of the website to scrape
url = 'https://www.example.com/products'

# Send a GET request to the website
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Find and extract product data
products = []
for item in soup.find_all('div', class_='product'):
    name = item.find('h2').text
    price = item.find('span', class_='price').text
    rating = item.find('span', class_='rating').text
    reviews = item.find('span', class_='reviews').text
    products.append([name, price, rating, reviews])

# Save data to CSV
df = pd.DataFrame(products, columns=['Name', 'Price', Rating', 'Reviews'])
df.to_csv('data/products.csv', index=False)
df.to_json('data/products.json', orient='records')
